# Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines critical performance optimizations needed to handle large datasets (2000+ employees, thousands of projects) efficiently. Current implementation will cause significant UI freezes and delays with large-scale data.

## Critical Performance Issues & Solutions

### 1. Excel Import Performance (15-30 seconds delay)
**File:** `lib/excel/parser.ts`

#### Problems:
- Console logging on every row (lines 129-366)
- Nested loops for pivot format detection (O(n√óm) complexity)
- Synchronous processing blocks UI thread

#### Solutions:
- [x] **P0: Remove excessive console logging** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
  - Keep only summary logs (start/end/errors)
  - Use conditional debug flag for detailed logging
  
- [ ] **P0: Implement Web Worker for parsing**
  - Move XLSX parsing to background thread
  - Add progress reporting via postMessage
  - Prevents UI freezing during import
  
- [ ] **P1: Add streaming/chunked processing**
  - Process Excel data in batches of 100-500 rows
  - Yield to main thread between chunks using `requestIdleCallback`
  
- [ ] **P1: Optimize pivot format detection**
  - Sample first 10 rows instead of all rows
  - Cache date column detection results

### 2. UI Rendering - No Virtualization (5-10 seconds delay, laggy scrolling)
**Files:** `components/features/hours/HoursGrid.tsx`, `components/features/gantt/GanttChart.tsx`

#### Problems:
- Renders ALL cells in DOM (100,000+ elements for 2000 employees √ó 52 weeks)
- No pagination or windowing
- Heavy re-renders on state changes

#### Solutions:
- [ ] **P0: Implement virtual scrolling for HoursGrid**
  - Use `@tanstack/react-virtual` or `react-window`
  - Only render visible rows + buffer (30-50 rows max)
  - Lazy load cell data as user scrolls
  
- [ ] **P0: Add pagination option**
  - Show 50-100 employees per page
  - Add search/filter to find specific employees quickly
  
- [ ] **P1: Optimize GanttChart for large datasets**
  - Implement custom virtualized Gantt or switch to performance-optimized library
  - Consider `gantt-task-react` alternatives like `dhtmlx-gantt` with virtualization
  
- [x] **P1: Memoize expensive computations** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
  - Wrap components in `React.memo()`
  - Use `useMemo` for filtered/sorted data
  - Implement proper dependency arrays

### 3. Optimization Algorithm Performance (30-60 seconds delay)
**File:** `lib/optimization/optimizer.ts`

#### Problems:
- O(n¬≤) complexity in `findBestEmployee` (line 348-395)
- Creates full n√óm skill matrix upfront (line 205-226)
- No caching of repeated calculations

#### Solutions:
- [ ] **P0: Add Web Worker for optimization**
  - Run optimization in background thread
  - Show progress bar with cancel option
  - Return results incrementally
  
- [ ] **P1: Implement caching layer**
  - Cache skill scores per employee-project pair
  - Cache employee availability per week
  - Invalidate cache only on data changes
  
- [ ] **P1: Optimize candidate selection**
  - Pre-filter candidates by skills before scoring
  - Limit to top 50 candidates based on quick heuristic
  - Use spatial indexing for skill matching
  
- [ ] **P2: Add early termination**
  - Stop when "good enough" solution found
  - Add time budget (max 10 seconds)
  - Allow user to accept partial results

### 4. Metrics Calculation (Called frequently, O(n√óm) complexity)
**File:** `lib/metrics.ts`

#### Problems:
- Multiple iterations through all assignments
- Recalculated on every change
- No caching of intermediate results

#### Solutions:
- [ ] **P0: Implement incremental updates**
  - Update metrics only for changed data
  - Keep running totals instead of recalculating
  - Use dirty flags to track what needs recalculation
  
- [ ] **P1: Add computation caching**
  - Cache metrics per employee/project/week
  - Use WeakMap for automatic garbage collection
  - Memoize `calculateSkillsMatch` results
  
- [ ] **P2: Batch metric updates**
  - Debounce calculations by 100-200ms
  - Combine multiple changes into single update
  - Use `requestAnimationFrame` for UI updates

### 5. State Management & localStorage (1-2 second freeze per edit)
**File:** `store/useScheduleStore.ts`

#### Problems:
- Entire state serialized to localStorage on EVERY change
- No debouncing of persistence
- Large JSON.stringify operations block UI

#### Solutions:
- [x] **P0: Debounce localStorage writes** ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE
  - Add 500ms debounce for persistence
  - Use `lodash.debounce` or custom implementation
  - Show "saving..." indicator during write
  
- [ ] **P1: Implement differential updates**
  - Track changed fields only
  - Use patches instead of full state
  - Consider IndexedDB for large datasets
  
- [ ] **P1: Add compression**
  - Use LZ-string compression for localStorage
  - Reduces storage size by 60-80%
  - Faster serialization/deserialization
  
- [ ] **P2: Paginate data loading**
  - Load only visible data initially
  - Lazy load assignments as needed
  - Implement data virtualization in store
